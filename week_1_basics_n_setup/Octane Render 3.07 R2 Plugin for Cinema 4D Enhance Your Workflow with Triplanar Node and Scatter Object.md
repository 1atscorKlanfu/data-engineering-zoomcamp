## How to Use Octane Render with Cinema 4D
 
Once you have installed and activated your plugin, you are ready to use Octane Render with Cinema 4D. Here are some of the steps you need to follow:
  
### Step 1: Set up your scene in Cinema 4D
 
You can create your scene in Cinema 4D as usual, using any of the tools and features available in the software. You can use any of the native objects, splines, deformers, generators, modifiers, etc. You can also import models from other sources or use third-party plugins.
